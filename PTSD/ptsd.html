            <p>Post Traumatic Stress Disorder also known as PTSD is a disorder that affects thousands of indiviauals not just first responders except from what ive seen affects police the most. For police officer their rate to get PTSD in 2018 was 29% of officers would be willing to get diagnosed with it and spoke out about it thats not counting officers who dont think they have it or dont want to speak out about it. Officersx can develop PTSD on the job from a lot of things including but not limited to watching someone die, killing someone, not saving someone and so much more. Something even as small as getting in a car crash can cause them PTSD. How can we stop officers from getting PTSD? Well... we can but we also cant. All we can do to help officers stop getting PTSD is by stop being violent to them and be nice with them. Treat them like you would a normal person, dont shoot them or beat them for just being a cop. Thats really the only thing we can do to help them but we cant completely elimate the concept of PTSD for officers because humans wouldnt be able to do that and everything on their job would have to work 100% of the time. Example: a helicopter randomly failing. We cant control that but a cop getting shot we can. Now how can we help police suffering from PTSD is a way easier question. The easiest way we can help police with PTSD is like the rest of them be nice to them. Remind them they matter dont force them to go to therapy or something if they want to thats their choice you can suggest it but dont force them to do it.</p>
