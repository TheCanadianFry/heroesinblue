            <h1>Introductions</h1>
            <p>Welcome to The Heroes In Blue offical website! This websites purpose is to bring awareness to police mental health issues and statistics. This website will contain information regarding general information on police mental health issues, police officer suicide, police officer PTSD, police officer racism and brutality, how can you help and police and tributes which are videos giving respect and paying tribute to our heroes in blue. Now I am going to explain the purpose of each section. The purpose of the police officer mental health awareness general information section is to just give you general facts and informatrion about police officer mental health. The second section about police officer suicide talks about the likelyhood of an officer taking their on life, and some background behind why and what we can do to lower the percent rate. The third section is the same as the second just it focuses on police officer ptsd, the rates and what we can do to lower it. The fourth section is going to talk about police racism and brutality and clearing some facts out about it. The fifth section gtives information on how to help lower those rates and how to create change and it will also goes over how to spread awareness on that topic. The last section is police tributes which was explained earlier. The other idea this website is trying to push is under that uniform police are humans to! If they take off that vest, shirt, badge all that they are human! Just like you or me. Thats what one of our goals is here. You dont have to agree with us on the topic but atleast hear us out. Lastly I just want to thank anyone for taking the time to read all this and please come into this with an open mind.
