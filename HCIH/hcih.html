            <p>This is one of the questions on this website ive answered time and time again so this whole page is dedicated to explaining in depth how you can help deal with these issues. Now im going to split it into 2 sections of them being 18 and above (people who can vote), and 17 and below (people who cant vote). The only reason they are seperated is so people who are able to vote know how they can help with that and people who cant dont have to read through it if they dont want to but I recommend both sides read it all.</p>
