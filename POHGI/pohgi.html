            <p>This section is going to breifly go over police officer mental health issues and talk about the whole topic. If you want more information on the topic feel free to check out our other tabs about it or conduct your own research. The first topic we are going to talk about for it is officer stress and anxiety. 52% of canadian officers reported moderate to severe stress 11% being extremly severe. Stress on the job can be caused by the fears and realizations that one day they might walk out that front door and never walk back through it. I will go over more in depth on the other tab. 88% of Canadian officers reported moderate to severe anxiety 12% being extremly severe. Anxiety can be caused by high levels of stress or exposure to certain situations. 87% of officers reported moderate to severe depression and 13% being extremely severe. Depression can be caused from trauma at the job and can lead to high stress levels, anxiety and sometimes suicidal thoughts. 29% of officers were in the diagnostic range to be diagnosed with PTSD. PTSD can be caused by extremly traumatic events happening on the job site and can lead to flashbacks and nightmares. I will go over all these facts more in depth including the suicide rates in different tabs and explain them better. Note: this informationm has most likely changed because the best information found was from a 2018 public document released. Following stats of previouis years and updates on policies by guess is these numbers have only gone up and not gone down. These numbers will most liekly continue increasding until we as a community relaize what is happening and decide to create positive change on the topic.</p>
