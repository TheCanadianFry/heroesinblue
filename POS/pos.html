            <p>Policing is one of the higher stress rate jobs and a job with some of the highest suicide and depression rates. Suicide is an issue that hits everyone and can happen to anyone but within a 2018 report it was shown police officers are more likely to commit suicide, plan it and think of it vs the general population. This report was taken in 2018 but by looking at past years rates, the increase and any policy changes im making an educated guess and saying the rate has gone up for officers. 8.3% of Municipal and provincial officers thought about commiting suicide while 9.9% of RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted Police) thought about commiting it. The general population according to this reports rate was only 5.8%. That's 2.5% lower then city and provincial and 4.1% lower then RCMP. 3.4% of municipal and provincial police planned commiting suicide while 4.1% of RCMP planned it with only 2.2% of the general population planning it. The provincial and city police are 1.2% then general population while RCMP are 1.9% higher then general population. Are you starting to see the issues with these numbers yet? No? Well 0.2% of provincial, municipal and RCMP attempted suicide while the number is unknown for the general population its below 1%. With the word attempt that could mean succesfuly doing it or just attempting and thankfully not being able to. If even me telling you all these statistics doesnt get the message through let me say it like this.</p>

            <p>Police officers are more likely to take their own life then they are to die by the hands of a violent criminal. Police are also more likely to engage in suicidal behaviours then they are to engage with the general population. Let that sink in for a second.</p>

            <p>Now why might these numbers be so high you may ask? My personal opinion and the research I have conducted has led me to the conclussion these numbers are so high is because no one cares enough about the issue or speaks out about it enough for the higher ups and politics to change the issue. Police officers are supposed to be these tough people who can go through hell and back each and every day yet still live a normal life, not be haunted by things they had to do. They get blamed for everything wrong with the world nowadays ev en though they would take a bullet for you. They do nothing wrong yet all of them are hated with a passion by most people. No one cares about a police officer commiting suicide, the news doesnt because that doesnt bring them clicks, follows, views, watches but anything putting police in a bad way do. No matter how many peoples officers save, rescue or anything even if they rescue 1000 people but dont rescue 1 or kill 1 person thats enough to make them think ending it is worth it. We need to remind police they are valued, we thank them for their service and they do so much good for the community. They cant constintly be reminded of the bad things they do even if they save 1000 people we shouldnt keep reminding them of the 1 they didnt save or killed we need to remind them and endorse the ammount of people whos life theyve made positive impacts on! These rates arent going to lower until we speak out about this issue. That is my opinion is how we can make change, why change isnt made and why they do it. Below this will be a graphic to better depict the statistics i gave earlier.</p>
