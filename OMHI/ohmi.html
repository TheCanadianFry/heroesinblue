        <div id="Stress">
        <h2>Stress</h2>
            <p>Police Officer Stress affects 52% of officers moderately to severe affecting 11% extremely severe</br>
            Police officer stress can be caused by hundreds of issues but im going to break it down into 2 categories:</br>
            operational stress and organizatioanl stress Now im going to explain what each of those categories is</br>
            Operational stress is caused by the stress and trauma that police encounter at their work. Exporsure to traumatic situations</br>
            such as car accidents, abuse, sexual assault, and violence scenarios can leave officers vulnerable to operational stress</br>
            Operational Stress Injuries (OSI) can lead to substance use, troubles outside of work, nightmares and more like that.</br>
            Now you might be wondering to yourself, how can we lower these numbers how can we help? Well thats easier said then done.</br>
            The easiest way to acomplish this goal is to be expose officers to less traumatic experiences which means we must become better.</br>
            Until we make positive and better change in and around ourselves we cannot make positive change for them.</br>
            Until we become less selfish and do what is best for all of humankind we cant make positive change for anyone.</br>
            Ok sorry for going off a bit there but the next type of stress we will be talking about is organizatioanl stress</br>
            Organizational stress is caused by a few things which are: innefective leadership, problematic tenure and promotion processes,</br>
            understaffing and lack of resources can all be causes of organization stress and the only way I believe we can help with this issue</br>
            is by promoting the fact that some police deptartments can use more money to fix these issues. In fact police officers reported</br>
            organizatioanl stress to cause more stress then operational stress.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="Depression">
        <h2>Depression</h2>
            <p>Police officer depression affects 87% of police officers with moderate to severe while 13% being extremely severe</br>
            Depression for police officers can be caused by stress, anxiety, ptsd and the causes of all of those. Depression can cause<br/>
            suicidal thoguhts and intents amongst officers it can also make them more angry, sad and have mood swings.</br>
            Now this section here is going to be really short because the causes were explained in the other 2 sections.</br>
            The main focus of this section is going to be how we can help officers suffering and prevent the numbers from being so high</br>
            The way we can help the officers who are currently suffering is reminding them we care and support them. Be nice to them.</br>
            The way we can stop future officers is the same as the other 2 sections stop exposing them to such horrible things.</br>
            I have said this before and i am going to say it again and again!</br>
            The only way we can create positive change amongst officers is by creating positive change amongst ourselves.</br>
            That is how we can prevent and help officers from getting and currently suffering with depression</p>
        </div>

        <div id="Anxiety">
        <h2>Anxiety</h2>
            <p>88% of police officers reported moderate to severe anxiety with 12% extremely severe. Anxiety can be caused by the same things listed in stress aswell as organizational culture. Organizational culture unlike operational and organizational stress affects police officers the most because organizatioanl culture is basically whats expected of them. Police are expected to be these tough, do whats right no matter what loyal people but being held to that standard is a lot. Officers who dont conform to that can recieve harrasment from coworkers and barries to career advancements. This standard affects anxiety the most but can affect stuff like stress, depression, PTSD and even suicide. Anixety and organizational stress can affect northern and indigenous policing the most because theyre in smaller communities which can me isolation, long back up times, lack of back up, long distasnce to travel, lack of help, and much much more. The reason anxiety, stress and depression are all in the same section because they can all be linked back to the same causes and the same way to fix them. Again the way to fix organizational culture is easier said then done as usual because not only is this an expectation set by us its one set by their superiors and themselves. So in order for this to change not just does the general populations mindset has to change everyones does including the officers and their superiors.</p>
